First, thanks for being here.

### Developer thoughts

Right now, all RDF in JS libraries are spread all over the place.

There are several github organizations:

https://github.com/rdfjs-base
https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-ext
https://github.com/rdfjs

There is a W3C community group [here](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/) which created [this site](https://rdf.js.org/), hosting the canonical RDF-JS Specifications, created by various task forces in the CG.

There is a list of various libraries [on the W3C wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/wiki/Comparison_of_RDFJS_libraries), but it is slightly out of date.
